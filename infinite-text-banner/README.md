A list of elements gets repeated to fit the browser width and is animated like a news ticker. Needs gsap to work.

- new elements: create additional `<li>` tags in `index.html`   
- change speed in `script.js`: `const speed = 50;`
- change height in `style.css`: `height: 50px;`
- change space between element in `style.css`: `margin: 0 3em 0 0;`
